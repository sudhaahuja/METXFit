# MonoXFit

## Installation

```bash
cmsrel CMSSW_8_1_0
cd CMSSW_8_1_0/src
cmsenv
git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
git clone https://github.com/LPC-DM/DMSFit.git -b SuperMonojetFit
scram b -j16
```

## Produce fitting trees

1. Modify `config/category.py` to point to the correct input root file, where category = [boosted, resolved, monojet]. The input root file is the output of `makeFittingForest` from PandaAnalysis.
2. Call `source buildModel.sh category` to create `category.root`
3. Call `python runModel_category.py` to create `combined-model_category.root`

## Running a single fit

The `datacards` directory contains the datacards for each individual category and the combined cards. Within a category, the datacard including all the mass bins can be generated by calling `MegaScripts.sh`. The output is in `MASS/combined_all.txt`. The one thing you might have to change is making sure the datacards correctly point to the combined-model_category.root files produced above.  **Any changes to the datacard must be made here and in the datacard used for scans (see below)**

To run the fit:

```bash
cd datacards/
combine -M AsymptoticLimits -t -1 datacard_name.txt --rAbsAcc 0 --rMax 30
```

And the signal masked-fit:

```bash
cd datacards/
text2workspace.py combined_2cat.txt --channel-masks
combine combined_2cat.root -M MaxLikelihoodFit --saveShapes --saveWithUncertainties --setPhysicsModelParameters mask_tight_sig=1,mask_loose_sig=1
```

## Running the limit scan

Use `datacards/combined_datacards/scan_monoZp.sh` as an example for how to run the limits over several signal points. The output will be dumped in limits_*.txt. 

**Any changes to the scan datacard must be made here and in the datacard used for fits (see above)**

To run the scan:

```bash
cd datacards/combined_datacards/
source scan_monoZp.py
```

## Making postfit plots

All plotting tools are in `plotting/`. They must be run after running the fit (or limit scan, depending on what plots you want to make). These scripts automatically point to the ROOT files generated by the above combine calls, so there is nothing you need to do.

```bash
python plot_ratio.py                                             # plots the xfer factors - no need to rerun now that the inputs are finalized
python plotStackedPostFit.py                                     # makes the stack plots with prefit and postfit comparisons to data
python diffNuisances.py -g pulls.root ../datacards/mlfit.root    # draws the pulls plot
python plotLimits.py                                             # makes the limit plots (both sigma and sigma/sigma_theory)
```

The output directories are specified inside the above scripts and will need to be changed to fit the user's preferences. This should probably be changed to an environment variable.
